        <p>A roof is one of the most critical components of a building. It protects the structure from the elements and provides shelter for the inhabitants. However, over time, even the most well-maintained roof will eventually need to be replaced. In this article, we will discuss when it's time to replace your roof.</p>
        <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight:700;padding-top: 20px;">Age of the Roof:</h2>
        <p>The age of the roof is one of the most significant factors to consider when deciding whether to replace it. Most roofs last for 20-25 years, depending on the type of material used. If your roof is approaching or has exceeded this lifespan, it is likely time to replace it.</p>
    
        <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight:700;padding-top: 20px;">Visible Damage:</h2>
        <p>If you notice visible damage to your roof, such as cracked or missing shingles, or leaks in the ceiling, it is time for a replacement. Even small damages can lead to more significant problems over time, so it is essential to address them as soon as possible.</p>
    
        <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight:700; padding-top: 20px;;">Energy Efficiency:</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">If your energy bills have increased significantly, it could be a sign that your roof is damaged and not providing adequate insulation. A new roof can increase the energy efficiency of your home, saving you money in the long run.</p>
