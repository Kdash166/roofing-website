        <p>A roof is a critical component of any building, protecting it from the elements and providing shelter for its inhabitants. Over time, however, a roof can become damaged and in need of repair. Knowing when to repair a roof can help prevent further damage and costly repairs down the line. In this article, we will discuss when you would need to repair a roof.</p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight:700;padding-top: 20px;">Age of the Roof:</h2>
        <p>The age of the roof is a crucial factor in determining whether it needs repair or replacement. Most roofs last for 20-25 years, depending on the type of material used. If your roof is approaching the end of its lifespan, it may be time for a repair or replacement.</p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight:700;padding-top: 20px;">Visible Damage:</h2>
        <p>If you notice visible damage to your roof, such as cracked or missing shingles, or leaks in the ceiling, it is time for a repair. Even small damages can lead to more significant problems over time, so it is essential to address them as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2 style=" font-size: 18px; font-weight:700; padding-top: 20px;;">High Energy Bills:</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">A damaged roof can also affect the energy efficiency of your home. If your energy bills have increased significantly, it could be a sign that your roof is damaged and not providing adequate insulation.</p>

        <p>Asphalt shingles are coated with granules that protect them from UV rays and other elements. If you notice granules in your gutters or missing from your shingles, it could be a sign that your roof is aging and needs repair. Contact a professional roofer to inspect your roof and determine if it needs repair or replacement.</p>
